# Swift-Voce Approximation Script

## Overview

This Python script calculates the Swift-Voce approximation from experimental engineering data. The script reads tensile test data from a text file, processes it to compute various curves and approximations, and saves the results to text files. It also offers options to plot the data and results at different stages of the computation.
